# Color Picker with Sliders

## Overview

This project is a simple **Color Picker** that allows users to dynamically adjust colors using sliders and view their corresponding **HEX, RGBA, and HSLA** values in real time. The background color updates instantly based on the selected values.

## Features

- Adjust **Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B)**, and **Opacity (O)** values to get the RGBA and HEX color formats.
- Modify **Hue (H), Saturation (S), Lightness (L), and Alpha (A)** to get the HSLA color format.
- The background color updates in real-time as users interact with the sliders.
- **Copy** HEX, RGBA, and HSLA values to the clipboard with a single click.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handles real-time updates of color values and clipboard functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Sliders**: Users can change values using sliders for RGB, Opacity, HSL, and Alpha.
2. **Display Section**: The selected color values are displayed in different formats (HEX, RGBA, and HSLA).
3. **Background Update**: The webpage's background changes instantly based on the chosen values.
4. **Copy Button**: Users can copy any displayed color code by clicking the copy icon next to it.

## Installation

No installation is required! Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser and start using the color picker.
